# Privacy Policy (Server List Explorer)

Last updated: 2025-12-15

This Privacy Policy explains how Server List Explorer collects, uses, and shares information. In this Privacy Policy, "App" and "application" mean Server List Explorer. This document is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute legal advice.

## Who we are

Server List Explorer is an open-source project maintained by an individual developer ("SpoilerRules", "we", "us", or "our"). Server List Explorer is distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0).

## Data controller

For purposes of applicable privacy laws, the data controller for telemetry and analytics data described in this policy is SpoilerRules.

## Scope

This Privacy Policy applies to the desktop version of Server List Explorer.

## Telemetry and analytics ("usage data")

Server List Explorer can send diagnostic and limited usage data to help improve stability and performance. By default, "Share usage data" is enabled. You can turn it off at any time in Settings.

Telemetry and analytics data may include:

- Crash and error details (for example, stack traces and error messages)
- Application information (for example, version and distribution)
- Device and system information (for example, OS version and architecture)
- Limited usage information (for example, feature usage and whether certain settings are enabled)

We do not intentionally collect personal data. However, telemetry and analytics data may include personal data in some cases (for example, if an error message includes a file path or other text from your device or your input).

## How we use data

We use telemetry and analytics data to:

- Diagnose and fix bugs and crashes
- Improve stability and performance

We do not sell personal information and we do not use telemetry and analytics data for advertising.

## Where telemetry is sent

We use Sentry for diagnostic reporting and related analytics. We configure Sentry to not send default personally identifiable information (PII), but telemetry may still include personal data in some cases.

Sentry is a third-party service provider and processes data according to its own privacy policy:
https://sentry.io/privacy/

Sentry may process certain connection data (such as IP address) as part of operating its service.

## Your choices and controls

- Turn telemetry on/off: use the "Share usage data" toggle in Settings (Data & privacy). Changes take effect after restarting Server List Explorer.
- Disable for one run: start Server List Explorer with `--no-telemetry`.

## Data retention

Telemetry and analytics data is retained according to the retention settings of the Sentry project and Sentry's policies.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes are effective when posted in the repository and reflected by the Last updated date above.
