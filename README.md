## Getting Started

Getting started with Server List Explorer is straightforward. Follow these steps to get up and running:

### For Windows Users

1. **Download Server List Explorer**: Head to our [releases page](https://github.com/SpoilerRules/server-list-explorer/releases/latest) and download the **`ServerListExplorer_Win64_Portable_Bundled-JRE.zip`** version.

2. **Extract the Files**: Extract the contents of the **`ServerListExplorer_Win64_Portable_Bundled-JRE.zip`** file to a folder (unzip).

3. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the files and double-click **`server-list-explorer.exe`** to launch the application.

   The bundled Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is included, so no separate Java installation is required.

### For macOS and Linux Users

1. **Install Java**: Ensure you have Java 11 or later installed. If not, download and install it from the [official Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21).

2. **Download Server List Explorer**: Head to our [releases page](https://github.com/SpoilerRules/server-list-explorer/releases/latest) and download the version that best fits your needs:
    - **`ServerListExplorer.jar`** (for the full version)
    - **`ServerListExplorer-minified.jar`** (for the smaller, minified version)

3. **Run the Application**: Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where the downloaded **`.jar`** file is located, and run the following command:
   ```sh
   java -jar ServerListExplorer-minified.jar
   ```
   Or for the non-minified version:
   ```sh
   java -jar ServerListExplorer.jar
   ```
